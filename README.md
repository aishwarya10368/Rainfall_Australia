# Rainfall_Australia
This project focuses on predicting next-day rainfall in major Australian cities using machine learning techniques, specifically employing a Random Forest Classifier. By utilizing the "Rain in Australia" dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains a decade of historical rainfall data in CSV format, the project aims to provide accurate forecasts that can help mitigate human and financial losses associated with unpredictable weather. The target variable, RainTomorrow, indicates whether it will rain the following day, classified as "Yes" or "No." The methodology includes data preprocessing steps such as importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, handling missing values with appropriate imputation methods, and balancing the dataset by oversampling the minority class. Feature engineering is performed to extract relevant features, including temporal variables (year and month) and rainfall amounts, alongside visualizing the distribution of rainfall and temperature across different locations. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and a Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict the target variable, with the model's performance evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports. Additionally, KMeans clustering is applied to identify weather patterns, and the results are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Overall, the model achieves a high accuracy rate in predicting rainfall occurrences, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in weather forecasting.
